## Observing the differences Amplitude, Period and Phase Shift have on a Sine plot.

This presentation contains a Sine plot. You can observe the difference changing various variables has on the plot.

## Sine Plot - The Amplitude
The Amplitude is the height from the center line to the peak (or to the trough).
<!-- insert diagram displaying Amplitude -->
## Sine Plot - The Period
The Period goes from one peak to the next (or from any point to the next matching point).
<!-- insert diagram displaying Period -->

## Sine Plot - The Phase Shift
The Phase Shift is how far the function is horizontally to the right of the usual position.
